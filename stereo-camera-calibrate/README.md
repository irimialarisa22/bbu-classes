# stereo-camera-calibrate

- This project allows you to calibrate 2 cameras separately using the checkerboard pattern. We used the paired calibration pattern images to obtain the rotation matrix R and translation vector T that transforms points in first camera coordinate space to second one coordindate space.

You should see something like this:
